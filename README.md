## Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) Logos

In this repo, we have artwork in standard formats for the ASWF [projects](https://www.aswf.io/projects) and programs. We prepare artwork in 2 formats (PNG & SVG) and at least 3 versions (color/black/white).

With many browsers, you can right click and copy the logo of your choice below. Please note that although PNG is more common, SVG file sizes are smaller, supported in all modern web browsers, and a high-resolution format suitable for both print and high-resolution computer screens.
